Data Preprocessing:

Target Variable: 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df.
Feature Variables: All columns from application_df excluding 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'.
Removed Variables: 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were dropped as they were not targets or features.
Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:

Neurons and Layers: Attempted with 8 hidden nodes in the first layer and 5 in the second layer.
Achievement of Target Performance: Unable to reach the 75% accuracy target.
Steps Taken for Improvement: Added layers, removed columns, increased hidden nodes, and experimented with activation functions.
Model Summary:

The deep learning model achieved around 73% accuracy.
To improve, consider a model with better input-output correlation by performing thorough data cleanup and trying different activation functions.
A recommendation is to iterate and experiment with various models until a higher accuracy is attained.
